## Product updates

Chef server 12.1, Ent Server 11.3.2 are in progress, patching Redis is a big
push here.  Manage and Supermarked updates coming soon too.

## RFCs

https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/118 garnered the most discussion.
Consensus is that having Ohai behave on the CLI like it does during a Chef run
is a nice win, but there are some details still being ironed out.  Also,
moving the hints systems into a central config will probably help our users.


>  The core desire is to have a way to configure ohai so that things like knife bootstrap can leave the system set up so that ohai run directly and ohai run from Chef will behave the same way. 
> [the] most illustrative use cases so far:
>  -  I want to disable an ohai plugin,
>  - I want to set the ohai plugin path.
>  - I want to change the source of data for the hostname plugin.
>  - I want to retrieve EC2 metadata in the ec2 plugin.

RFCs to move OpenBSD to tier 2 approved and changing `resource attributes` to
`resource properties` also approved
(https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/128) -- This is a pretty interesting
change.  Ubuntu 10.04 is on track to be yanked.

## Next time

https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/135 - some proposals to change resource property default behaviors. Mostly I'm opposed to adding more API keywords as they only have utility in some edge cases, and make the finding the useful API methods harder to find and use.
https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/pull/136 - clarify some Chef resoure naming precedence
