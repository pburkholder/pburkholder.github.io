DevOpsDays DC key points

- John Willis thinks we have lots of reading time on our hands
- Lean Enterprise was focus of one session talk: "I read this book and here is
  how I implemented it and it worked for us"
- Josh Corman's talk on Rugged DevOps was one of the more interesting relevant
  ones
  - 'root access is a bug'
  - 'give devs a tool before taking one away'
- OpenSCAP talk: A lot of the same design goals as Chef audit-mode. Lots of
    support scans for platforms already. Haven't looked at it yet. Julian may
    also have thoughts on it.
    - Fed space loves opensource since procurement process for COTS is so
      painful.
 - Ken Johnson and Mike Nescott's talk on DevOops security also pretty
   interesting/relevant to the fed space.


Open space on Windows Automation
 - Lots of Powershell
 - Success stories around https://octopusdeploy.com/ Octopus for deployments
   being used to automate release
 - WINDOWS ADMINS WANT CHEF SERVER TO RUN ON WINDOWS.
   - Just like Linux/Unix admins shudder when they're told they have to run a
    core service that is Windows only.
