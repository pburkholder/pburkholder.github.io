Thread-Topic: No way to prevent loading of root certificates in IE6 (tb)


Dear Peter:

Thanks for your email.  You can prevent loading of trust root
certificates into IE6 by disabling the user root store.  This is an
action an admin can take to prevent some or all users in the network
from installing a trusted root cert, and this should be applied to any
kiosk machine.

To disable loading of trust root certificates into IE6,  target a Group
Policy Object and disable users' ability to select a new root CA to
trust. 

You can do this as follows:

1.Click Start, click Run, type mmc, and then click OK. 

2.On the Console menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in.
  
3.In the Add/Remove Snap-in dialog box, click Add. 
 
4.In the Add Standalone Snap-in dialog box, in the Available standalone
snap-ins list box, click Group Policy, and then click Add.
  
5.In the Group Policy Wizard, click Browse, select the target GPO, click
OK, and then click Finish to close the Group Policy wizard. The  Group
Policy Editor appears.

6.In the Group Policy Editor, under Computer Configuration, click
Windows Settings, click Security Settings, click Public Key Policies,
and then right click properties on Trusted Root Certification
Authorities.

7.Uncheck the "Allow users to select new root certification authorities
(CA) to trust" option.

I hope this helps answer your concern. Please let us know if you think
we've missed anything and thank you for taking the time to email us.
